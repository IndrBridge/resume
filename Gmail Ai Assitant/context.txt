Project Overview
We are building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for an AI-based tool that:

Connects to Gmail via OAuth.
Automatically summarizes emails and extracts actionable tasks.
Suggests follow-up replies and reminders for those tasks.
This product is initially targeted at a small group of users (e.g., a friend and their colleagues), all using individual Gmail accounts.

Core Objectives
Parse Emails for Tasks

Use simple NLP or rule-based methods (enhanced by OpenAI) to detect references such as “follow up,” “schedule a meeting,” “review this document,” etc.
Generate AI-Powered Summaries & Replies

Call the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to summarize long email threads and propose draft responses.
Chrome Extension UI

Provide a lightweight, in-context interface for viewing auto-generated tasks and replies directly from Gmail.
FastAPI Backend

Handle OAuth with Google, manage user tokens securely, orchestrate calls to the OpenAI API, and store minimal data (tasks, summaries, etc.).
Technical Scope
Language & Frameworks

Front End: Chrome Extension (HTML, JS, minimal CSS)
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
AI Integration: OpenAI API (Chat Completion endpoint)
Database / Storage

Store tasks, user tokens (if needed), and minimal metadata in a lightweight solution (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, or a simple JSON for MVP).
Security

Use Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.
Store refresh tokens securely (encrypted at rest) if doing server-side token management.
Request only the necessary OAuth scopes (e.g., Gmail read-only) to reduce risk.
User Flow (MVP)
Install Extension

User installs the Chrome extension, which injects a small popup or sidebar in Gmail.
Sign In with Google

From the extension, user initiates the OAuth flow and grants permission for read access to Gmail.
Email Fetch & Processing

The extension calls the FastAPI server to retrieve recent emails or relevant email content (subject, snippets, etc.).
FastAPI then sends email content to the OpenAI API for summarization or task extraction.
Task & Summary Display

The extension UI shows AI-generated tasks (including optional due dates) and a suggested reply or follow-up action.
Task Confirmation & Reminders

User can confirm or edit tasks.
The system may send basic reminders (e.g., notifications or daily digest) about pending tasks.
Data Persistence

Confirmed tasks (and any associated metadata) are stored in the backend DB for later retrieval or analytics.
Immediate Limitations
Gmail Only: No Outlook or other email providers at this time.
Single-User Focus: The system is not multi-tenant or enterprise-ready; each user’s data is managed individually.
Basic Reminders: Simple push notifications or email reminders, without advanced scheduling logic.
Minimal UI: An embedded extension popup or basic sidebar, no standalone web app yet (planned for future phases).
Future Plans
Expanded NLP
More sophisticated detection of deadlines, locations, or contact details from emails.
Full Web Dashboard
A separate React/Vue/Angular front end to view and manage tasks in one place.
Team Collaboration
Assign tasks to other team members or collaborate on shared email threads.
Calendar Integration
Automate scheduling or propose meeting slots directly from the extension.
CRM Integration
Sync leads and tasks with tools like HubSpot or Salesforce.
Key Deliverables for MVP
Chrome Extension
Displays detected tasks and suggested replies in the context of Gmail.
FastAPI Backend
Receives email data via OAuth, calls OpenAI API, returns structured tasks/summaries, and stores minimal user/task data.
OpenAI Integration
Summaries and task extraction (plus optional follow-up replies).
Security & Privacy
Secure handling of tokens, minimal data retention, and transparency about what’s being accessed in Gmail.
Success Criteria
Users can log in with their Google accounts through the extension.
System automatically identifies at least some actionable tasks in new emails.
System suggests a relevant reply for a user to copy/edit/send.
Users can view and manage tasks (confirm, discard, mark complete).
Basic notifications or reminders help ensure tasks are not forgotten.
