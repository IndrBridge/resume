# JT808GW Project Scope

## 1. Project Overview

### Current Status
- Demonstration gateway for RTVS integration
- NOT intended as a full-featured production gateway
- Focus on protocol-level implementation and basic gateway logic

### Primary Purpose
- Demonstrate integration between JT808 and GB28181 protocols
- Showcase RTVS video streaming capabilities
- Provide reference implementation for protocol conversion

## 2. Implemented Features

### Core Gateway Functions
1. Protocol Level Access:
   - Basic command handling
   - Packet splitting
   - Message validation
   - Protocol response handling

2. Video Streaming:
   - JT1078 to GB28181 video stream conversion
   - Real-time video viewing support
   - Integration with national standard platforms

3. Protocol Conversion:
   - JT808 (部标) to GB28181 (国标) signal conversion
   - SIP client implementation
   - Signal routing and handling

### Integration Points
1. RTVS Integration:
   - Video stream handling
   - Protocol conversion support
   - Real-time viewing capabilities

2. GB28181 Platform Support:
   - Standard compliance
   - Signal conversion
   - Platform compatibility

## 3. Current Limitations

### Data Persistence
- No permanent data storage
- Protocol-level responses only
- No historical data retention
- No state management beyond session

### Business Logic
- Limited to RTVS-related processing
- No additional business logic implementation
- Basic protocol handling only

### User Interface
- Minimal interface implementation
- Limited monitoring capabilities
- Basic operational controls

## 4. Planned Enhancements (TODO)

### Data Management
1. Storage Implementation:
   - Redis for recent data
   - Local file storage for historical data
   - Data persistence logic

2. Data Transfer Service:
   - Database integration
   - Kafka implementation
   - File-based transfer system

### User Interface
1. Vehicle Monitoring:
   - Position tracking
   - Real-time location display
   - Vehicle status monitoring

2. Historical Data:
   - Trajectory playback
   - Historical route visualization
   - Timeline-based replay

### Performance Improvements
1. Core Libraries:
   - Parser optimization
   - Performance enhancements
   - Code efficiency improvements

2. System Optimization:
   - Resource usage optimization
   - Processing efficiency
   - Response time improvements
